# ShopWeb
A responsive multi-page website for a fictional web design service, built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5.Includes a hero with a framed image, features grid with custom SVG icons,pricing section with comparison table, and separate Reviews and Contact pages—featuring a custom drag-to-scroll JS carousel that works on both mouse and touch.
NOTE:
The carousel for reviews is not working properly on mobile (Works only if u are in desktop mode and it is still glitchy) Ill try and fix it later.
